# Customer_Segmentation

A study on Customer segmentation with the following problem statement.

A bank wants to roll out Christmas offers to their customers. But Bank does not want to roll out same offer to all customers  instead they want to roll out personalized offer to particular set of customers. If they manually start understanding the category of customer then this will be not efficient and also they will not be able to uncover the hidden pattern in the data ( pattern which group certain kind of customer in one category). They don't want more than 5 group as this will be inefficient for their campaign.

The dataset provided is a dataset of all the customers in the bank. The data has been cleaned and outliers have been removed. Feature engineering has been performed to find the relavent fatures for clustering.

Finally K means is used to create the clusters in the data, by testing and evaluation it is found that 4 groups is the optimal number of groups that can be segmented in this dataset.
